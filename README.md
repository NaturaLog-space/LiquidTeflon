# LiquidTeflon
## Corrosion Resistant Teflon Parts
## 3D Printable Teflon Resin
## Polymerizing TetraFluoroEthlyene with UV light

- UV light between 200nm-420nm to cure teflon

- polymerization initiatior and catalyst

- disuccinic acid and ammonium persulfate initiator

- solvent for room temperature resin

- A method of 3d printing pure teflon using tetrafluoroethylene would make teflon parts widely available to use in the industry within dupont and other companies.

- Disposable gloves made with alternating layers of teflon and kalrez would make flexible and highly resistant gloves.

- Low cost disposable teflon gloves made with alternating layers of butyl rubber and teflon

- gloves that are dipped for a thin coat then cured in alternating layers of butyl rubber and teflon 

- teflon fabric is waterproof

- teflon fibers formed from spray curing resin into uv light
